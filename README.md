# Prediction of whether the applicant will be able to repay the loan or not

# Introduction :
Lending Club is a US peer-to-peer leading company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register it's offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

# Goal:
From the information available on whether the borrower paid the loan or charged off, we build a model to predict whether the new applicants will be able to pay the loan or not
